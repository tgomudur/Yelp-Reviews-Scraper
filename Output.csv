    Pretty cool place and good burgers. I liked it because it's different from the rest of Scottsdale. Staff was friendly, tables and silverware were clean and the whole vibe was casual and inviting. Our burgers were huge and tasty. There are many varieties on the menu. It is also reasonably priced. There was nothing negative about it and that's why I gave it 5 stars. I love these little places like this one. Local, small, inviting, casual and amazing food.

    Their food is pretty good but the customer service is absolutely terrible!!!!! Basically if you are not Bosnian you will be treated like shit. I don't understand why is it so hard to be polite to people that are coming in there to give you their business. I went there few times for lunch with few different people and the lack of customer service never fails!!!! Angry faces, people starring, cashier not telling you the amount.....needless to say, I'm not going back. It's a shame that they discriminate against people who are not their own kind.

    I keep returning to this location because it's right next to my house but never again. No matter what the situation is they always try to sell you something. I get it they are trying to make money but it's pathetic how much they try to up sell you. I had a 2 month old tire that had a bubble on the side of it, they called it ""the impact bubble"" therefore it's not covered under warranty. There was no impact!!! They sold me the new tire for $60 (cheap) but with installation and bunch of other fees it ended up being $108!!!! Jesus Christ where did the other $48 come from!?!? Their customer service sucks!!!! I'm never going back.

    I hate doing this but seriously, this is the worst bbq that I ever tried. Their sandwiches are cheap I'll give them that but they are also very small and tasteless. I went there for lunch and I actually bought 3 different sandwiches cause I wanted to try out different stuff. Long story short; I took one bite out of each sandwich and I threw them away. Fries were super old and soggy...I just can't find one positive about this place.

    I used to go there for years, the service was always mediocre to say the least but I had a discount so paying $6 for a car wash was pretty sweet. Lately (since the ""raid"") they are just terrible and I would give them a big fat 0 if I could. They laugh at you, your car ends up dirtier than when you brought it in, they are slow, they tried to up sell you even when you are clear that you only want a wash. Even if you decide to go for the expensive option of the wash....guess what, they will wash it the same as the cheap version. They used to polish cars in the sun.....this kills the paint.

    Probably the worst customer service in the world. The owner is always angry and he act like he's doing you a favor by taking your money. The pizza is usually super greasy but I don't even want to talk about the food, I just can't believe how rude this guy is. He never ever says thank you or anything at all other than ""what do you want"" and the price. I think he's Albanian (judging by the flag on the walk) he does some dirty business in the back. My brother and I noticed few times some guys going in the back with duffle bags and leaving after like 5-10 minutes with different bags. There is something dirty going on here I guarantee it, I think they are using this business as a smoke screen for money laundering. I will never go there again for as long as I live!!!!

    Their pizzas are amazing. But the service along with silverware and the plates are  terrible!!! Servers are way too casual and often look dirty...I get it, that's part of the theme but it just doesn't feel right. It feels dirty. The tables are usually wet when you sit down because they were wiped down with a nasty soaked towel. Oh well I love the food so I will go back but it's kind of pricey for the service and atmosphere.
